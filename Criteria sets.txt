--  The value in the data must match at least one of the following values
--=
--  The value is equal to the following value
--<>

--# This is a value to use to compare to.  
--The # is valid for a pre-agg value and a post-agg value.
--* This is one of the columns being used to form the aggregation key.
--+ This is one of the columns to sum by the aggregation key.
--$ This is the column to perform the post aggregation comparison on
--& This is the type of comparison that is being performed
